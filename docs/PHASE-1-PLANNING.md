## Current Architecture Analysis and Assessment

### Overview

The current Next.js poll application is structured as follows:

- **Admin System:**  
  - Located in `app/admin/` with authentication logic in `lib/admin-auth.ts`.
  - Provides admin-specific routes and controls.

- **Authentication:**  
  - Implemented in `app/auth/` and `auth-context.tsx`.
  - Protected routes ensure only authenticated users can access certain features.

- **Poll Functionality:**  
  - Core poll logic in `app/polls/` and database interactions in `lib/database.ts`.
  - Users can create, vote, and view polls.

- **Supabase Integration:**  
  - All backend data storage and authentication handled via `lib/supabase.ts`.

- **Charting:**  
  - Recharts 3.1.2 is installed, but not yet integrated into poll result displays.

### Assessment

- **Strengths:**
  - Modular codebase with clear separation of concerns.
  - Secure authentication and admin controls.
  - Scalable database integration via Supabase.
  - Ready for data visualization with Recharts.

- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - Role management is basic; lacks granularity (e.g., moderator role).
  - Poll results are not visualized with charts.
  - Accessibility has not been formally audited.
  - Testing coverage is limited.
  - No email notification system for user engagement or admin alerts.

## Phase-by-Phase Implementation Plan

### 1. Enhanced Role Management

**Objective:**  
Expand the current authentication system to support multiple roles: admin, moderator, and user.

**Deliverables:**
- Role definitions and permissions matrix.
- Database schema updates for user roles.
- UI/UX updates for role-based access.
- Middleware for role-based route protection.

**Timeline:**  
Week 1–2

**Tasks:**
- Update Supabase schema to include `role` field for users.
- Refactor authentication logic to check for roles.
- Implement moderator dashboard and permissions.
- Update admin panel to manage user roles.

---

### 2. Poll Result Charts with Recharts

**Objective:**  
Integrate Recharts to visualize poll results for users and admins.

**Deliverables:**
- Bar, pie, and line charts for poll results.
- Responsive chart components in poll detail pages.
- Export/download chart data feature.

**Timeline:**  
Week 2–3

**Tasks:**
- Design chart components using Recharts.
- Integrate chart components into poll result pages.
- Add data export functionality (CSV, PNG).

---

### 3. Accessibility Audit and Improvements

**Objective:**  
Ensure the application meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

**Deliverables:**
- Accessibility audit report.
- Remediation of identified issues.
- Automated accessibility testing in CI.

**Timeline:**  
Week 3–4

**Tasks:**
- Conduct manual and automated accessibility audits.
- Fix color contrast, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, etc.
- Integrate accessibility checks into testing suite.

---

### 4. Comprehensive Testing Suite

**Objective:**  
Achieve high test coverage for all critical features.

**Deliverables:**
- Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- CI pipeline for automated testing.
- Test coverage reports.

**Timeline:**  
Week 4–5

**Tasks:**
- Set up Jest and React Testing Library for unit/integration tests.
- Implement Cypress for end-to-end testing.
- Add test scripts to CI workflow.

---

### 5. Email Notification System

**Objective:**  
Implement email notifications for user engagement and admin alerts.

**Deliverables:**
- Email templates for poll creation, votes, and admin notifications.
- Integration with Supabase or third-party email service.
- User preferences for email notifications.

**Timeline:**  
Week 5–6

**Tasks:**
- Design and implement email templates.
- Integrate email sending logic in backend.
- Add UI for managing notification preferences.

## AI Collaboration Strategy

| Phase | AI Collaboration Approach |
|-------|--------------------------|
| Enhanced Role Management | Use AI to generate role-permission matrices, suggest security best practices, and review access control logic. |
| Poll Result Charts | Leverage AI to recommend effective chart types, generate sample data, and review chart accessibility. |
| Accessibility Audit | Use AI-powered tools (e.g., axe, Lighthouse) for automated audits and remediation suggestions. |
| Testing Suite | Employ AI to generate test cases, identify edge cases, and review test coverage. |
| Email Notification System | Use AI to draft email templates, optimize subject lines, and analyze user engagement metrics. |

---

## Success Metrics and Tracking System

**Key Metrics:**
- Role management: 100% of users assigned correct roles; zero unauthorized access incidents.
- Chart integration: 100% of polls display charts; positive user feedback on visualization.
- Accessibility: Achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance; 0 critical accessibility issues.
- Testing: >90% code coverage; all critical paths tested.
- Email notifications: >95% delivery rate; <1% bounce rate; user opt-in/opt-out tracked.

**Tracking System:**
- Use project management tools (e.g., Jira, GitHub Projects) for task tracking.
- Integrate analytics (e.g., Sentry, Google Analytics) for monitoring.
- Weekly progress reports and milestone reviews.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Role escalation vulnerabilities | Medium | High | Peer code reviews, automated security tests, principle of least privilege. |
| Chart rendering performance | Low | Medium | Lazy loading, data pagination, optimize chart components. |
| Accessibility non-compliance | Medium | High | Early audits, continuous testing, user feedback loops. |
| Incomplete test coverage | Medium | High | Enforce coverage thresholds in CI, regular test reviews. |
| Email deliverability issues | Low | Medium | Use reputable email service, monitor bounce rates, implement SPF/DKIM. |
