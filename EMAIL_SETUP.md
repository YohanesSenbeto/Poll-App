The Poll App now includes a comprehensive email notification system that sends automated emails for various events.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Email Service Integration
- **Resend Integration**: Modern email service for reliable delivery
- **Email Templates**: Professional HTML templates for different notification types
- **Notification Preferences**: User-configurable email preferences

### ✅ Email Templates
1. **Welcome Email**: Sent to new users when they sign up
2. **Poll Created**: Sent when a user creates a new poll
3. **Vote Received**: Sent to poll creators when someone votes on their poll
4. **Admin Alerts**: Sent to administrators for system notifications
5. **Weekly Digest**: Weekly summary of user activity

### ✅ Notification Preferences UI
- User-friendly interface in profile settings
- Toggle switches for different notification types
- Real-time preference saving

### ✅ Backend Integration
- Email notifications integrated into poll creation
- Email notifications integrated into voting system
- Best-effort email delivery (won't break core functionality)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install resend
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```env
# Resend Email Service Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Application Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Optional: Custom From Email
# FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

### 3. Get Resend API Key

1. Go to [Resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Go to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Add it to your `.env.local` file

### 4. Database Schema

The system uses the existing `user_profiles` table. Make sure it has a `notification_preferences` column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE user_profiles
ADD COLUMN notification_preferences JSONB DEFAULT '{
  "pollCreated": true,
  "pollVoteReceived": true,
  "adminAlerts": false,
  "weeklyDigest": true
}'::jsonb;
```

## Testing the Email System

### 1. Test Email API Endpoint

The system includes a test endpoint at `/api/test-email` that can be used to test different email types.

### 2. Test Email Page

Visit `/test-email` in your application to test the email system with a user-friendly interface.

### 3. Manual Testing Steps

1. **Create a poll**: Should trigger "Poll Created" email
2. **Vote on a poll**: Should trigger "Vote Received" email for poll creator
3. **Check notification preferences**: Users can manage their preferences in profile settings

## Email Template Customization

Email templates are defined in `lib/email.ts`. You can customize:

- **HTML Design**: Modify the HTML structure and styling
- **Content**: Update text, links, and branding
- **Images**: Add company logos or custom graphics
- **Colors**: Match your brand colors

## Notification Preferences

Users can control which emails they receive:

- **Poll Creation**: Notifications when they create polls
- **Vote Received**: Notifications when someone votes on their polls
- **Admin Alerts**: System notifications (admins only)
- **Weekly Digest**: Weekly activity summaries

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Emails not sending**:
   - Check Resend API key is correct
   - Verify Resend account has sufficient credits
   - Check console logs for error messages

2. **Emails going to spam**:
   - Configure SPF/DKIM records for your domain
   - Use a verified domain for the "From" address

3. **TypeScript errors**:
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set
   - Check that Resend package is properly installed

### Debug Information

Check the browser console and server logs for:
- Email sending success/failure messages
- Resend API response details
- Notification preference loading errors

## Security Considerations

- Email failures are handled gracefully and won't break core functionality
- User preferences are respected before sending emails
- Admin alerts are only sent to verified administrators
- Email content is sanitized to prevent XSS attacks

## Performance Impact

- Email sending is asynchronous and won't block user actions
- Email failures are logged but don't affect user experience
- Rate limiting should be implemented for production use

**Phase 5 Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

The email notification system is now fully implemented and ready for production use. Users can receive notifications about poll activity, and the system includes comprehensive testing and debugging tools.
