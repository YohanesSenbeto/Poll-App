# Reflection on AI CLI Usage

I used Gemini CLI to analyze and refactor my code.  
Benefits:
- It quickly explained complex parts of the codebase.  
- Helped me generate a new feature with minimal effort.  
- Useful for catching patterns and simplifying functions.  

Limitations:
- Sometimes suggestions need manual adjustment.  
- Works best for small, focused files.  

Overall, AI CLI tools save time and improve productivity during development.

### Gemini CLI Interaction

The following is a reflection on the interaction with the Gemini CLI:

1.  **Installation Attempts:** The initial goal was to install a CLI tool.
    *   The first attempt `npm install -g @google/generative-ai-cli` failed with a `404 Not Found` error. This was due to an incorrect package name.
    *   A web search was performed to find the correct package name, which was `@google/gemini-cli`.
    *   The second attempt `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` failed with a `SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN` error, indicating an SSL certificate issue, likely due to a corporate network environment.
    *   The third attempt `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli --strict-ssl=false` also failed with the same SSL error, suggesting the flag wasn't being respected by a dependency's post-install script.
    *   The final attempt `set NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 && npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` was proposed to disable SSL verification at the process level, but the user cancelled the operation.

2.  **Code Explanation:**
    *   The user requested an explanation of a file with a typo: `gemini explain ./app/polls/tpage.tsx`.
    *   The CLI tool correctly identified the typo and found the intended file: `./app/polls/page.tsx`.
    *   A detailed explanation of the file's functionality, structure, and key technologies was provided.

This interaction demonstrates the CLI's ability to debug problems, interact with the user, and provide detailed explanations of code.
